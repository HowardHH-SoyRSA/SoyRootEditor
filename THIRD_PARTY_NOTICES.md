# Research and third-party notices

This file records the source lineage, research references, and license decisions used while developing SoyRootBio/BioInsAlgo 0.2. It is not a substitute for the license text of any named project.

## What is incorporated

The repository is an evolution of HowardHH-SoyRSA's [BioInsAlgo `agent/refine-primary-centerline-log` branch](https://github.com/HowardHH-SoyRSA/BioInsAlgo/tree/agent/refine-primary-centerline-log), whose repository license is MIT. That lineage is compatible with this repository's [MIT License](LICENSE).

No source code from the reference-only projects below is claimed to be copied, linked, vendored, or redistributed in this tree. Runtime Python packages are installed separately by the user through normal package management and remain under their own licenses.

Individual repository licenses must be checked before any future reuse. |
| [RooTrak](https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.186221) | Reference for automated 3D recovery of roots from soil in X-ray micro-CT using visual tracking. | Publication/algorithm reference only; this project expects already reconstructed root-only geometry and does not incorporate RooTrak. |

## Additional license boundary

Some related tools advertise that they are “open source” or make a repository publicly visible without including a detectable license. Public visibility alone does not grant permission to copy, modify, or redistribute source code. Those projects are therefore listed only as scientific/design references unless a compatible license is established later.

Likewise, a Creative Commons license on an article normally governs the article, not a separately distributed software repository. GPL software can be run externally for comparison or validation, but its source was not combined with this MIT-licensed implementation.

## Runtime dependencies

The application declares Open3D, NumPy, SciPy, HDBSCAN, scikit-learn, NetworkX, pandas, Matplotlib, openpyxl, psutil, Flask, and tkinterdnd2 as Python install-time dependencies. The interactive editor frontend uses React, Three.js, three-mesh-bvh, Zustand, and the Vinext build tool. These packages are not source-code lineages of SoyRootBio and remain under their respective licenses; consult the installed distributions and lockfile when redistributing a packaged application.

This notice lists research and design references; it is not a claim that every linked project, paper, or remote branch is required at runtime. The authoritative dependency list for this source tree is the `[project.dependencies]` table in `pyproject.toml`.
